**README: Running Node.js Application with npm**

This guide will walk you through the steps to run a Node.js application using npm (Node Package Manager) and the `npm run start` command.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/). npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   Clone the repository of your Node.js application to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone github.com/ahmadaziz6720/GSC_Bottani.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**:
   Change your current directory to the root directory of the cloned project:

   ```bash
   cd 3-src/Website
   ```

   Replace `<project-directory>` with the name of your project directory.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the project dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

4. **Start the Application**:
   Once the dependencies are installed and environment variables (if any) are configured, you can start the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   This command will execute the `start` script defined in the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file.

5. **Access the Application**:
   After starting the application, it should be accessible through your web browser or any other appropriate client, depending on the nature of your Node.js application.


### Conclusion

You've successfully set up and started your Node.js application using npm. If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to the project's documentation or seek help from the project maintainers.
